My original portfolio assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/elspear/old-portfolio)

I decided it would be good practice to create a new version of my portfolio - essentially from scratch - whilst adding in some JavaScript as well. 

More updates to come:
- About page
- Upload more projects
- Find more ways to incorporate JavaScript and fun CSS tricks
- Hamburger menu and improve web responsiveness
